  <h1>Opinion Piece – Superbowl 58: How Kelce's Actions Negatively Impacted Young Viewers</h1>

  <p><em>By Kushi Arun</em></p>

  <p>Throughout the history of American football, numerous athletes have achieved greatness while being a positive influence to their fans. However, some have failed to uphold this admirable persona. Since its start in 1920, the NFL has seen extraordinary athletes who have dedicated their lives to the game and brought entertainment to their fans. Many who excel at the game become motivation for aspiring individuals to attain the same success. Athletes often use their platform to spread positivity and motivate young minds who aspire to be in the league. The influence pro athletes have on teens and children all over the nation is evident, as many try to emulate them. One such athlete is Travis Kelce, a tight end for the Kansas City Chiefs. Throughout his NFL career, Kelce has been considered one of the best players in the league. The numerous red flags circling around Kelce have been silenced due to his success on the field, despite the negative influence it has on many teens.</p>

  <p>Travis Kelce has had a career full of temper tantrums, but these have often been overlooked as they generally took place at regular season games and his performance overshadowed them. However, during Superbowl 58, Kelce had an altercation with head coach Andy Reid on the biggest stage in America. Kelce was triggered after a fumble on the field while he was not playing. This led him to yell in Reid’s face and push him, causing a teammate to pull him back. When addressing this on his podcast, Kelce simply stated that he was a passionate guy. What should have been an apology became a tribute to Reid’s greatness and Kelce's respect for him. Kelce took no accountability, and the media spun the incident as an example of loyalty and drive. Reid supported him, and the media critique faded quickly. Kelce laughed it off during his podcast and showed no remorse. He even stated that he did not care what anyone thought. As a public figure, Kelce has a responsibility to his fanbase to set a good example. This includes understanding the influence he has on others and ensuring the message he sends is positive. While some may claim it is unfair for public figures to bear this responsibility, it comes with the privilege of being a professional athlete. Kelce’s dismissive attitude and lack of accountability are shameful, especially when combined with the media’s failure to hold him responsible.</p>

  <p>What was not discussed by Kelce or the media was the influence his actions could have on the millions of teens watching the game. According to the NFL, Superbowl 58 drew 123.4 million viewers. Many of these viewers were young, impressionable teens. Seeing Kelce lash out at an elder sends a damaging message to kids who look up to him. The message that emerged was: "When you feel big emotions, it's okay to resort to violence." Kelce and Reid repeatedly excused the incident as passion. But Kelce is a grown adult and should be able to control his emotions. Other players in the same game managed their emotions appropriately. Repeatedly excusing Kelce's behavior promotes it and encourages young fans to copy it. The Girl Scouts Research Center reports that nearly half of girls aged 13-17 wish they were as skinny as fashion models. This shows the massive influence public figures have on youth. Just as media influence leads to eating disorders, Kelce’s behavior risks normalizing violence.</p>

  <p>Kelce’s celebrity status only magnifies his influence. His relationship with pop star Taylor Swift brought him even more attention. During her Eras Tour and album release, Swift was one of the most famous people on the planet. Her presence at Chiefs games boosted Kelce’s jersey sales by 400% and grew his podcast audience by over 300,000 listeners. His social media following doubled, and the NFL saw $1 billion in increased publicity thanks to Swift’s appearances. Because of this, Kelce’s every move was in the spotlight. Yet his actions at the Superbowl barely made headlines. Kelce refused to acknowledge his responsibility while benefiting from Swift’s global fanbase. This shows a refusal to accept the responsibilities that come with fame. Many young fans see Kelce as a role model, and his behavior sends the wrong message.</p>

  <p>The danger of excusing Kelce’s actions as passion is that it teaches teens that passion means aggression. This promotes a generation that will struggle to resolve conflicts without confrontation. If teens believe anger is the only way to show drive, it will affect how they interact in their personal and professional lives. It contributes to increasing polarization in our society. If public figures don't model respectful disagreement, we risk creating a world where common ground becomes impossible.</p>

  <p>Kelce’s behavior also highlights a double standard. When women show emotion in sports, they are often labeled aggressive or ungrateful. Gymnast Mykayla Skinner was harshly criticized for merely frowning after a disappointing score. Serena Williams was penalized for challenging a call, even though male tennis players have done far worse without consequences. Male athletes like Kelce get excused as "passionate," while women are called emotional or disrespectful. This teaches male teens that they can act out without consequences, while girls learn to suppress their emotions. As these teens grow up, the imbalance contributes to fewer women in leadership roles and less diversity in decision-making.</p>

  <p>Kelce’s negative actions have been ignored due to his performance, but this sets a dangerous precedent. His lack of remorse and accountability reinforces the idea that passion must be violent. Media outlets and the NFL must acknowledge how this shapes young minds. The double standards in play only worsen the issue and promote a gendered expectation of behavior. These early messages shape future generations, and it's crucial that public figures and institutions take their impact seriously.</p>
