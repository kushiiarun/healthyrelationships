    Hi! My name is Kushi and I am a rising sophomore. I started this course with the hope of cultivating healthy habits for kids to use in their friendships now and in the future. I understand the importance of relationships and the hurt when friendships end or become toxic. This is hard for younger kids to understand and cope with, which is the reason for this course.

    I have been a Girl Scout camp counselor multiple times where I learned to work well with children as well as keep them active and engaged. I also worked as lead in Fremont Debate Academy teaching 3rd–5th graders about debate and argument strategies. Finally, I taught a 4-week course at Harvey Green Elementary on news and current events in a kid-friendly atmosphere. There, I created the content independently and taught independently.
